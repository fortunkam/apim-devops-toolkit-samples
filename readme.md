# Extractor samples for the APIM DevOps resource kit

Powershell scripts to run both the creator and the extractor for the [APIM Devops resource kit](https://github.com/Azure/azure-api-management-devops-resource-kit) 

Needs to have 2 APIM instances configured (source and destination) and will need tweaks to the scripts depending on where the APIM toolkit is loaded from.
